# CrossUI Flutter Playground

This is a demonstration app for the `crossui_flutter` package. It showcases all the core components implemented in Flutter using the CrossUI design system.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd apps/flutter-playground
   ```
3. Fetch the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Supported Components

- **Typography**: Responsive text variants (H1-H3, Body, Muted).
- **Buttons**: Primary, Secondary, Outline, Ghost, and Destructive variants with multiple sizes.
- **Alerts**: Semantic notifications (Info, Success, Warning, Error).
- **Cards**: Modular card structures with support for headers, footers, and interactive states.
- **Inputs**: Themed text input fields with support for placeholders and obscure text.

## Development

The components used in this playground are linked directly from `packages/flutter`. Modifying code in the package will reflect here immediately.
